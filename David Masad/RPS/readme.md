A set of classes for playing Rock Paper Scissors, or any other single-round simultaneous game where the rules are defined in a (ususally) symmetric matrix.

**Game.py** defines the Game class, which in turn contains the *action_list* and *payoff_matrix*.

**Players.py** defines the Player class and several child classes, each of which has its own behavior.

**Referee.py** defines the Referee class which manages the game between players and reports the score.
